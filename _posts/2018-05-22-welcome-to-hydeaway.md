<p class="message">Hydeaway is a simple <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> theme for personal websites and blogs that updates the original <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde" target="_blank">Hyde</a> theme and borrows a little from the 'refreshed' <a href="https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout" target="_blank">Hydeout</a>.</p>

### Elegant and Simple

Hydeaway sticks to the simple two-column design of the original Hyde theme, but to save screen space in the mobile/tablet versions, condenses the navigation area (by removing the added site icon).

### New Functionality

Hydeaway makes prominent use of the site tagline instead of the site description.

It also includes:
* A <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2018/05/23/site-icon">site icon</a> in the sidebar (on viewports above 825px)
* <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> icons for social media links and navigation buttons
* An optional <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">blog</a> page with a feed of all posts
* The ability to create <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2018/05/23/pinned-posts">pinned posts</a>
* A 'Newest Post!' alert for new posts (unless they are also pinned)
