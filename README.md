# Hydeaway

Hydeaway is a simple [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme for personal websites and blogs that updates the original [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme and borrows a little from the 'refreshed' [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout).

### Elegant and Simple

Hydeaway sticks to the simple two-column design of the original Hyde theme, but to save screen space in the mobile/tablet versions, condenses the navigation area (by removing the added site icon).

### New Functionality

Hydeaway makes prominent use of the site tagline instead of the site description.

It also includes:
* A site icon in the sidebar (on viewports above 825px)
* <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> icons for social media links and navigation buttons
* An optional blog page with a feed of all posts
* The ability to create pinned posts
* A 'Newest Post!' alert for new posts (unless they are also pinned)

### Features

The stark distinction between content and navigation bar means that posts (and content in general) can be viewed almost as a document, akin to a PDF or Word file.

Improved upon the UX of the theme by providing 'Back to Top' links in the mobile/tablet versions to return to the main menu.
